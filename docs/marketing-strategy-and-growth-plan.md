## Market Analysis

### Vietnam CRM Market Landscape

**Market Size**:
- ~650,000 registered businesses in Vietnam
- ~5M freelancers and gig workers
- Growing e-commerce market (Shopee, Lazada dominance)
- SME digitalization accelerating post-pandemic

**Market Trends**:
1. **Price sensitivity** — SMEs reluctant to pay $15-50/month for CRM
2. **Google ecosystem trust** — Most Vietnamese SMEs use Gmail + Sheets + Drive
3. **Simplicity preference** — Complex tools = lower adoption
4. **Mobile-first** — Majority access via mobile (but not mobile-app focused)
5. **Community-driven adoption** — Facebook groups, word-of-mouth still powerful in Vietnam

### Competitive Landscape

| Product | Target | Pricing | Strength | Weakness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Salesforce** | Enterprises | $165+/month | Feature-rich | Overkill for SMEs, expensive |
| **Airtable** | Creative teams | $20+/month | Visual, flexible | Complex, still costs money |
| **Notion CRM Templates** | Startups | $10+/month | All-in-one | Generic templates, learning curve |
| **Google Sheets (manual)** | Budget SMEs | Free | Familiar | No CRM workflow, messy |
| **HubSpot CRM** | Sales teams | Free (limited) | Professional | Geared to enterprise sales |

**Market Gap**: No purpose-built, completely free CRM specifically designed for Vietnamese SMEs.

### Opportunity

SheetCRM fills the gap for SMEs who want:
- ✅ Zero cost
- ✅ Vietnamese UX and content
- ✅ Simple interface (not enterprise-grade)
- ✅ Works with tools they already use (Google Sheets)
- ✅ Data ownership (no vendor lock-in)

## Channel Strategy

### Channel 1: Organic SEO (Vietnamese Search)

   - "CRM free cho freelancer: so sánh và lựa chọn" (Free CRM for freelancers: comparison)
   - "Tăng repeat sales 30% bằng CRM" (Increase repeat sales 30% with CRM)

2. **Problem-solving Posts**
   - "Khách hàng bị lãng quên? Dùng CRM" (Forgotten customers? Use CRM)
   - "Quản lý 200 khách hàng bằng tay thì mệt" (Managing 200 customers manually is exhausting)

3. **Case Studies**
   - "Shop online từ $0 đến $5K/month nhờ CRM" (E-commerce growth story)
   - "Freelancer tăng deals 40% bằng SheetCRM" (Freelancer success story)

4. **Comparison Content**
   - "Airtable vs Notion vs SheetCRM: So sánh đầy đủ" (Comparison article)
   - "Tại sao không nên dùng Google Sheets raw?" (Why not use raw Sheets?)

**SEO Keywords** (Vietnamese focus):
- "CRM miễn phí" (free CRM)
- "quản lý khách hàng Google Sheets" (manage customers with Sheets)
- "CRM cho freelancer" (CRM for freelancers)
- "CRM cho cửa hàng online" (CRM for e-commerce)
- "CRM Việt Nam" (Vietnamese CRM)

**Execution**:
- Blog on main website (SEO-friendly Markdown/static HTML)
- Guest posts on Viblo, Dev.to (Vietnamese + English tech communities)
- Long-form guides targeting high-intent keywords
- Update and expand regularly for SEO improvement

**Timeline**:
- Month 1: Launch 5 core how-to guides

3. **Host Q&A**: Monthly "Ask me anything about CRM and customer management" (builds authority)
4. **Share Case Studies**: Post member success stories (with permission)
5. **Provide Value First**: Free templates, checklists, guides (not asking for signup upfront)

**Content Examples**:
- "5 mistakes when managing customers with Google Sheets" → Mention SheetCRM solves these
- "Customer retention tips for freelancers" → Mention SheetCRM as tool to help
